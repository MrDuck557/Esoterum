block.esoterum-wire.name = Signal Wire
block.esoterum-wire.description = Used for basic signal transmission. Takes input from left, back, and right then outputs it to the front.

block.esoterum-junction.name = Signal Junction
block.esoterum-junction.description = Used for wire management, allows wires to intersect without interfering with eachother.

block.esoterum-router.name = Signal Router
block.esoterum-router.description = Splits input signal to every direction.

block.esoterum-node.name = Signal Node
block.esoterum-node.description = Transmits input signal to a linked node wirelessly, where it will output to all directions.
